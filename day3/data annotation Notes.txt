1. Display of the column headers are not as per standards
	Multiple places in the application (home, list, search, add, edit, update pages and reports)
2. Data validaations will be needed for constraint in the table
	on every page you use that colum for edit, search, add, calculation etc..
		client side (javascript)
		server side


	Thus we have ComponentModel.dataannotation

		This is done in the model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in MVC - we need the same UI to be used in multiple views (calculator, login screen) - this screen needs a lot of scripts

	Partial Views (a custom control, user control from previos version of asp.net)
